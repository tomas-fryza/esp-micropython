MicroPython Keypad Scanning

This MicroPython script scans a 4x4 keypad with rows as outputs
and columns as input pins with pull-up resistors. It detects
key presses and prints the pressed key.

Components:
- ESP32-based board
- Rows R1-R4: GPIO pins 19, 21, 22, 14 (set as Pin.OUT)
- Columns C1-C4: GPIO pins 12, 4, 16, 17 (set as Pin.IN with Pin.PULL_UP)
